I've had my eye on [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) for a while and needed a reason to finally look into it. At the same time [Chloé Charlier](https://lady-c.github.io/portfolio-chloe-charlier/index.html) discovered Ink and asked me if we could use it in the next gamejam—and that's what we did.

Ink is a narrative scripting language for games by Inkle. I've found it very straight forward to use and used it in other projects as well.
Learn more about it here: [https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/)

I used the ephread's plugin to use Ink with Godot: [https://github.com/ephread/inkgd](https://github.com/ephread/inkgd)

I also wrote some simple fragmentshaders in GLSL to animate the UI.
