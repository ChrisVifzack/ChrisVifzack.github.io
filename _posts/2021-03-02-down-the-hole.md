Another gamejam project I used as a Unity learning experience but this time a smaller scope. I reused the dialog system that I had previously implemented for [_A Story of Power_](/posts/a-story-of-power/)—a previous gamejam project. 

I also designed some of the characters. For example the fairy queen:
