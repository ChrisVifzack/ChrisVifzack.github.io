  alt: Tool to create polls during streams with Twitch chat integration.
---

Released on Steam in March 2023. 

A tool to create polls which can be used as overlay in a twitch stream. 


I mostly wanted to experiment with UI in Godot and learn how to add Twitch Chat integration. It worked well, so I decided to publish the project on Steam.
