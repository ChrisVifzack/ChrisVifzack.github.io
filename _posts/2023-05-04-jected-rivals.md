Released [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366850/Jected__Rivals/) in May 2023.

A fast-paced multiplayer game where characters get ejected from vehicles and can use gadgets in the air.
Players compete in a varity of Game Modes (e.g. Stuntrace, Glider Race, Crash Derby).

I worked ~2 years as a full-time programmer on this gameâ€”using Unreal Engine and C++ every day.
Among other things, I was mostly involved with:
- 3C (Character, Controls, Camera):
    - Ejecting the character from the vehicle
    - Character Locomotion + In-Air behavior
    - Responsive controls in multiplayer game (especially when switching from vehicle to character or vice versa)
- Vehicle & Character AI:
    - Setup behavior trees
    - Spline selection (fitness calculated using weighted sum)
    - Target selection for Crash Derby mode
