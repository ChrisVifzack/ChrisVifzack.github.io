Released on Google Play Store in 2016, but now only available [on APKCombo](https://apkcombo.com/prison-warden-s-dilemma/com.SuperiorCoding.PrisonWD/) archive.

A grid-based puzzle game where a prisoner has to escape from the warden and his guards. It features online leaderboards, character customization, and achievements.

This was a hobby project after university I worked on together with [Benjamin Schagerl](https://www.benjaminschagerl.com/). I mostly contributed to game design, level design and art.
