Annual 50-hours game jam that I am co-hosting with [Chloé Charlier](https://lady-c.github.io/portfolio-chloe-charlier/index.html) every November on [Itch.io](https://itch.io/).

What's special about this jam? - It allows the use of **self-made art and assets** only!

I created this particular format because after participating in a few game jams myself, I noticed that (especially when time is short) people tend to just mix-and-match different asset packs where original designs could be. However, I personally enjoyed it much more when submissions used self-made assets. As a hobby artist myself, I love that creators can put their own art in the spotlight in this jam.
