I had recently started to learn [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and wanted to use my new skills in a gamejam. Except for some bugfixing towards the end, I did not do any programming for this project.

I used blender to model and animate the robots in the game as well as the neon signs. I also setup the lighting and emissive materials in Unity.
