In my childhood, my dream job was to become a manga/comic artist or a game designer, or even better: A concept/character artist for games! I had made up my mind.

In highschool, I was introduced to programming and it instantly became my favorite subject—even in front of math.
Ever since then, I feel torn between my love for computer science and art. 

I decided to go to Technical University and earned my Master of Science degree with merit in 2016. My studies were focused on data science and AI in the field of robotics.

Since April 2021, I'm working as a programmer in the gaming industry—and have never been happier in my career.

However, I never lost my passion for art and design and I'm using personal projects and online classes (e.g. GameDev.tv or Udemy) to improve my skills in other areas of games.
